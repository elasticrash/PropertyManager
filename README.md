# PropertyManager
Simple Property Manager app in AngularJS /Node.js

This is actually my first combined angular/ node.js app. This is a work in progress.
Basically there is a small db in postgres that have 3 entities
- tenants
- properties
- payments

and there is a simple crud web interface in angular for those tables

for the time all labels are in greek // added multilingual support through angular translate
