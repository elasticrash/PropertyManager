# Query builder 
## (in the future I intend to add some some postgres specific sql structs, so far its pretty much generic) 

A little library for constructing raw sql queries. Still in infant stage.

Supports
select, from, where, inner join, left join, insert into, update

```javascript
var qb = require('tougo-query-builder');
var q = qb.select('*')+qb.from('property');
//SELECT * FROM PROPERTY;
var q = qb.select('*') + qb.from('property')+qb.leftjoin('property','tenant', 'tenant_id');
//SELECT * FROM PROPERTY LEFT JOIN TENANT ON PROPERTY.TENANT_ID = TENANT.TENANT_ID
```
